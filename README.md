## Contributions
• We are the first to explore the potential of the integration of Mamba and Transformer in time series. <br />
• We propose to adopt a hybrid architecture Mambaformer to capture long-short range dependencies in time series.<br />
• We conduct a comparative study to demonstrate the superiority of Mambaformer family compared with Mamba and Transformer in long-short range time series forecasting.
