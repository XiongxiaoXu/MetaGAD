## Contributions
• We study a new problem of few-shot graph anomaly detection; <br />
• We propose a novel meta-learning approach to learn to transfer node representations from self-supervised tasks to assist supervised tasks with little labeled anomalies; <br />
• We conduct extensive experiments on six real-world datasets with synthetically injected anomalies and organic anomalies. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach MetaGAD for graph anomaly detection.
